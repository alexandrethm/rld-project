# Custom RL Dojo for RPS

## How to run

I you want to test an algorithm in debug mode, run it via the `test.py` file. 

If you want to evaluate it against the other baselines, run the `eval.py` specifying the baseline against which you want to test it.

## Algorithms

- Simple Multi-armed-bandits: `jotaro.py`

- Bandit of bandits (*Meta-bandits/Banditception*): `giorno.py`

- Q-learning: `saitama.py`

- PPO-LSTM: ``levi.py`
